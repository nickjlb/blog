      <description>A long time ago I came across the Library of Babel. It&amp;rsquo;s based on a book, that I haven&amp;rsquo;t read, centered around an infinite library, containing every possible set of text imaginable. That means that although nearly all of the library contains gibberish, there are some books that contain a perfect transcript of the future, bibliographies of every human being, and any other text that can ever be written.
The website replicates that concept.</description>
