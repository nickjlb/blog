      <description>Turns out every empty platitude might be true after all. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling lost recently, really lost. I feel out of balance and unable to stabilize anything in my life. I just want some semblance of control and every measure that I take feels like it&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough to shift that balance.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve rediscovered my love for discussing society, incentives, structures, and philosophy that I encountered most while at college. And it made me realize, I can&amp;rsquo;t just listen and reflect upon the ills of society. The problems aren&amp;rsquo;t hypothetical â€” they involve real people that face these issues each day. Perhaps I can&amp;rsquo;t change the world, but I believe I can effect change locally. On the other hand, maybe dreaming big is worthwhile, because I should wring out any potential from the future I may have.</description>
