      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve rediscovered my love for discussing society, incentives, structures, and philosophy that I encountered most while at college. And it made me realize, I can&amp;rsquo;t just listen and reflect upon the ills of society. The problems aren&amp;rsquo;t hypothetical â€” they involve real people that face these issues each day. Perhaps I can&amp;rsquo;t change the world, but I believe I can effect change locally. On the other hand, maybe dreaming big is worthwhile, because I should wring out any potential from the future I may have.</description>

      <description>In general, I&amp;rsquo;m someone that has always been interested in, and thinks a lot about systems, and what they incentivise based on their structure. Whether that&amp;rsquo;s in terms of governments, sports, urban design, websites, or any other system that revolves around human interaction. Lately, that focus, as you may have seen has been on social networks.
As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve heavily researched alternative ideas for social networks. This is mostly inspired by my interest in privacy and trying to understand how these social networks affect society at large.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been increasing scrutiny placed on social media over the past decade, from all angles. Criticisms of their practices of election meddling, attention-stealing, data collecting, and generally being cesspools of humanity. Many of these companies have created walled gardens that discourage platform departure and have been optimized to be as attention-grabbing as possible. After all, more usage generates greater revenue, even if it&amp;rsquo;s at the detriment of a beneficial experience for the user.</description>
