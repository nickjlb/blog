      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s slow going but I&amp;rsquo;m finding some direction. Each decision I make reinforces a path. It&amp;rsquo;s opportunity cost but supercharged, in that one decision can rule out other options, but by choosing something over another in reinforces that behavior to the brain. The question isn&amp;rsquo;t how to have pure willpower to do make the right decisions, although that is certainly a part of it, the question is how to shape my life to incentive the right decisions.</description>

      <description>Turns out every empty platitude might be true after all. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling lost recently, really lost. I feel out of balance and unable to stabilize anything in my life. I just want some semblance of control and every measure that I take feels like it&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough to shift that balance. I was reminded today, listening to a podcast that most of our lives is spend aiming for goals.</description>

      <description>Everyday, it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m failing to correct. I have a list of all my biggest issues, I&amp;rsquo;m aware of what needs to change, but I don&amp;rsquo;t take the steps to fix it. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy for me to just keep following the same patterns, without adjusting anything, but recently more than usual, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing a voice that&amp;rsquo;s asking me to make these changes. I need to start taking small, consistent steps so I can stay on top of what I need to do.</description>

      <title>Finding My Way.</title>

      <description>Despite the last post, I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling to find that rhythm. I realized I&amp;rsquo;m holding myself back significantly in multiple ways. I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on my confidence in any major way, and that&amp;rsquo;s slowing me. Adding to that is my ability to make excuses for not starting anything. The only way to get better is to put in consistent work. Whether I want to make music, write, skate, or improve my mental health — I have to stick to it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a minute
Every time my life gets thrown out of wack — even in a good way — I forget the key ingredient that always makes things better. Even when I do remember, I forget the second most important part. Routine always provides me guidance. Feeling lost is one of the feelings that&amp;rsquo;s most constant in my life, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the more unpleasant feelings that I get.</description>
