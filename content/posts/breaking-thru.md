I think it's important for me to remember all the things I'd like to do. It's easy to forget and become an amorphous blob navigating through life and losing all the things that provide purpose. And it happens in subtle ways, when I get out of practice I lose the skills to further my ability to do those things I'd like to do.

Like writing. I don't just want to wait until the perfect storm of motivation and inspiration collide for me to practice writing, reading, meditating, cooking, programming, working out, and making music. These are all things I really appreciate and *want* to do! There is no reason I should lose them to overwhelm, distractions, or general malaise in my life.

Not all of these are fun all the time, and often they can be difficult, but they are always worthwhile which reminds me that not everything is about maximizing my joy. Overcoming difficulty brings purpose and structure to my life that is more meaningful to me than simply being pleasured in the most straightforward and effortless ways. I guess this is my argument against hedonism, not that those are particularly hard to come by.

Also, I realized this "blog" (what an ugly word) or collection of thoughts don't have to be rigid or complete to be worthy of making it online, I'd rather write as much as I can than wait for that perfect stream of consciousness to appear.
