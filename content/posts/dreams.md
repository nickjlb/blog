I don't think I have dreams. There aren't any specific goals I've always wanted to reach for, and I wonder if that resonates with others. Having dreams, especially distinct ones, is often portrayed in America. But perhaps as a byproduct of my aimlessness, I seem to lack any.

I want goals to aim for. I think a lack of direction is a result of vague and undefined endpoints. Having daily flexibility and stable income is not a dream â€” it's more survival and not wanting to waste away precariously at a suboptimal job. I'm worried that's my current trajectory given my lack of success in the "position acquisition" field.

On the other hand, no dreams means nothing to miss. Perhaps I should just follow the best path I encounter from moment to moment and let my life unfold as haphazardly (or perhaps as naturally) as it always would. Impossible to be disappointed and maybe only delighted as I find my way to what I appreciate. Instead of grinding away for the dream, I find what I want along each part of the journey.
