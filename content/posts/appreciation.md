## My Top 3 Songs On *Scaring the Hoes*
### Burfict! - Track 6/14
I really like this track because it is so bombastic straight from the beginning. Horns blaring, a thumping bass, and a really strong, addictive chorus from Danny Brown. Additionally, JPEGmafia's flow at the start of his verse sounds great.

### Kingdom Hearts Key (ft. redveil) - Track 9/14
I think the sample on this track sounds really beautiful. It just sounds expansive, green hills all around, with bells ringing. I like all three verses, but especially the final one from redveil with a really nice beat switch. I find that the flow bounces on the beat extremely well.

### God Loves You - Track 10/14
I love the sample flip on this song. Changing a gospel record to a hard-hitting, bass-filled track went extremely well. I want to be able to find samples like this, just to be able to turn them into something really interesting, like this.
