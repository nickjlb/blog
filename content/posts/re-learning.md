Now that I have a bit more focus, I'm finding it difficult to concentrate on creating. I want to create, I have a draw to do so (even if slightly dampened compared to the past), and I have more time that I've both found and carved out. But I've been away from all my creative outlets for so long that I feel both aimless and daunted.

Most recently, I've been consuming mountains of information, encouraging me to think about a wide range of topics, from the more narrow such as screentime and personal media consumption, to the broader concepts of government structure and city planning. So many ideas that aren't fully formed, thoughts that are incomplete about fixing broken systems and designing better ones, best maximizing my time, and creating better environments to help myself.

As I get back into routines and the structure that I need for my wellbeing, I will have even more time to think beyond my own personal needs and confront my higher-order interests. It's hard both thinking about doing anything and not doing anything, either path presents it's own set of challenges, but one is clearly more fulfilling.

That's why I'm starting out by writing. I have a relatively strong mastery of simple words, so at the very least this is my re-introduction to part of who I am. Starting small, working my way up.
