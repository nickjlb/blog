Everyday, it feels like I'm failing to correct. I have a list of all my biggest issues, I'm aware of what needs to change, but I don't take the steps to fix it. It's so easy for me to just keep following the same patterns, without adjusting anything, but recently more than usual, I've been hearing a voice that's asking me to make these changes. I need to start taking small, consistent steps so I can stay on top of what I need to do.

Most people don't have their problems listed out so clearly, so I need to take that and not just squander the opportunity. This is an important chance to create change in my own life. Part of this is simply finding the resolve to push through the excuses I usually use to explain why I'm not moving forward. Be that hating or feeling drained from work, being too busy in my social life, not having enough time, or being tired. Whatever it may be, I need the strength to push through despite those factors trying to drag me away from any change.

As I've said before, the longer I allow these patterns to take hold, the easier they will be to fall back into. I need to take the steps, I need to allocate time dedicated to problem solving and creating systems that combat the issues I deal with on a daily basis. It requires fighting these strongly ingrained mental patterns and shortcuts which does require a significant amount of energy. But it also is just a matter of mentality. If I believe I don't have the time, or that it's so much work I'd rather wait until later, then obviously nothing will be different. I'm not getting what I want out of my life and it is nearly all my fault. But that also means I have the ability to morph things into what serves me rather than continue to accept all the things that ultimately work against what I want in life.
