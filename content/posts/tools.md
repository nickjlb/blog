It can be difficult to identify whether anxiety can simply be overcome through thought or a shift in thinking. Given that it's literally in the mind, what is the difference between a healthy mind and one that overthinks? Mental disorders in general are fuzzy, and somewhat undefined as they manifest differently in everyone. This can make me somewhat skeptical of our understanding of psychology because it seems so undefined, and we don't know and can't observe those interactions.

It makes me wonder if the very real physical and emotional responses I have when I'm going through it are simply a spiral of negative thoughts and expectations I place on myself. If that's true, then it really is a mindset that is more about reframing my current situation than doing any other work to remove the anxiety. I suppose that the idea of cognitive reframing is a simple idea, but difficult to put into practice because our mental grooves are so worn in.

If that really is the stem of anxiety — an unhealthy mindset or perspective — it seems trivial, but I think that's reflective of how much perspective matters to the human brain, and the power of changing thought patterns. It gives me hope because instead of relinquishing to the idea that there is a fundamental, irreparable flaw that I have to manage rather than cure, it's possible to slowly build a repertoire of tools to create that shift.

By implementing these learned, immaterial tools that change the ways we think, it can result in a radical shift in perspective in the grand scheme. For a long time I've believed that as long as my needs are met, I have everything I already need to be satisfied and content. If my conceptions of anxiety are true, then my belief is right.
