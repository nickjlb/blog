This is my crow fan page. Whenever I see a crow, I always feel such endearment for whatever reason. They just look like chill birds that *can* outsmart me, but won't. They have the sleek, blacked out build going on, and they are just comforting for whatever reason. Whenever I see a crow, I give a nod just so they know I recognize and respect them.
