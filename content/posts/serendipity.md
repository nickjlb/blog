About two weeks ago, I drove from here to EDC alone. Although I usually go to festivals with friends, I had committed to the 3-day endeavor because I was so gobsmacked the first time I went. The first view I had of the festival was truly incredible because of its scale, with tens of thousands of people, more than a dozen stages, and intricate design across the entire speedway.

I wanted to arrive early, making the most of what I had committed a chunk of money to, and of course, for front-row parking. Although I was excited, I had this constant gnawing feeling that would not leave me alone. I would be by myself, amongst a sea of thousands and my mind would not stop racing about the things that *could* go wrong. But what really could go wrong? It's something I've done before (albeit not to this extent), and it's just people. The reason I couldn't settle my mind is because almost all the problems I realistically could face, came from within.

I often carry many self-fulfilling doubts and expectations. I might tell myself, "I'm stressed because what if this isn't fun", and then I will have created a cycle of self-doubt that begets the state of affairs I was concerned about. I'm essentially defeated as soon as I have the worry, becoming incessant and truly agonizing.

When I arrived, and even before I arrived, my thoughts were like bits of metal, grinding against each other in a cacophony of miserable worries. This further discouraged me because I would tell myself, "If I'm already having these thoughts, then it's only going to get worse." However, as I've grown accustomed to this personal hell, I fought through as best I could and drove to the speedway.

As luck would have it, things were off to a good start when I found an amazing parking spot despite the odds, and I was able to park quite close. On the other hand, although I had silenced and dispersed many of the thoughts, I had this gnawing feeling in my stomach and shoulders that I couldn't quite shake. I was really nervous even though I had nothing to worry about. Sometimes it's hard to know where irrational fears begin and normal nerves end, but I decided to press on about 30 minutes before the festival opening. And thank god I did.

I passed through the ticket scan and bag check, feeling relief that the procedural issues were dealt with, and made my way to that breathtaking view I had seen before. There it was, once again, in daylight instead and with a much smaller crowd, as I made it in on the first wave. But I still felt aimless. Despite the relief, I still could not shut down the fear of doing this alone, because of how worried I was about ruining my own time. Not the best spiral to be in at the start of Day 1.

After I arrived in Las Vegas, but before I drove to the festival, I searched for some semblance of shade in the near hundred-degree heat. I wanted to sleep before going in, if I could, so I chose a Jamba Juice about 15 minutes away to commence my slumber. But between the intense heat, gnawing, and incessant grinding, I wasn't having much luck. I tried to waste some time, so before long I found myself scrolling through Instagram, as one unfortunately does, and between the photos and videos leaving me duller than I once was, I came across one that suggested the following: "What if it went right? What if it went better than I could have ever possibly imagined?"

This felt special at the time because I felt that I was suffering. My thoughts felt destructive to my ability to have a good time, which truly felt awful. And it was easy to beat myself up about it, making it that much worse. But when I saw this video it made me realize. I always ask the inverse, because my mindset is inherently pessimistic. But what if I considered it this way? There really are so many possibilities and so many positive permutations of how my experience could go. This didn't fix my mindset. But it provided some light, and I found truth in it, after what was to come.

I made my way down the bleachers and looked around, worried but amazed that I had made it, and the sheer number of people that made it here with me. I felt both intimidated and excited by all the groups I saw, and I had some hope. I wasn't stuck in that same feeling. I gathered myself and focused on my needs — filling my hydro pack because I was dying of thirst. With a small delay, I got my water and moved to the side to repack my bag, and that's when it happened.

I was kneeling, pressing my jacket back into my bag when I saw two friends, that I hadn't seen in so long, with their group walking through this massive crowd of thousands of people. I had been first to get through, but by now the water lines had extended by 100 feet, and the crowd had gotten massive. The chance of me running into them was slim to none at any other moment. Had I been in line, getting water, I would not have seen them. Had I finished earlier, I also would've missed them. I ran up to them and found the group that would not only guide me through EDC, but more festivals going forward. Had I hidden away, I would never have made those connections.

I needed to consider what could go right. This was serendipity — there was no real chance of me running into them at any other point. If I had made any other choices, if they had made any other choices, I might have been alone. Maybe that would've been perfect too. But it's the fact that I never considered that beautiful moments can happen, not just terrible ones.
