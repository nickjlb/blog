About two weeks ago, I drove from here to EDC alone. Although I usually go to festivals with friends, I had committed to the 3-day endeavour because I was so gobsmacked the first time I went. The first view I had of the festival was truly incredible because of its scale, with tens of thousands of people, more than a dozen stages, and intricate design across the entire speedway.

I wanted to arrive early, making the most of what I had committed a chunk of money to, and of course, for front row parking. Although I was excited, I had this constant gnawing feeling that would not leave me alone. I would be by myself, amongst a sea of thousands and my mind would not stop racing about the things that *could* go wrong. But what really could go wrong? It's something I've done before (albeit not to this extent), and it's just people. The reason I couldn't settle my mind is because almost all the problems I realistically could face, came from within.

I often carry many self-fulfilling doubts and expectations. I might tell myself, I'm stressed because what if this isn't fun, and then I will have created a cycle of self-doubt that begets the state of affairs I was concerned about. Essentially defeated as soon as I have the worry, that becomes incessant and truly agonizing.

When I arrived, and even before I arrived, my thoughts were like bits of metal, grinding against each other in a cacophony of miserable worries. This further discouraged me because I would tell myself, "If I'm already having these thoughts, then it's only going to get worse." However, as I've grown accustomed to this personal hell, I fought through as best I could and drove to the speedway.

As luck would have it, things were off to a good start when I found an amazing parking spot despite the odds, and I was able to park quite close. On the other hand, although I had silenced and dispersed many of the thoughts, I had this gnawing feeling in my stomach and shoulders that I couldn't quite shake. I was really nervous even though I had nothing to worry about. Sometimes it's hard to know where irrational fears begin and normal nerves end, but I decided to press on about 30 minutes from the festival opening. And thank god I did.
