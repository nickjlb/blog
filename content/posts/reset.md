*It's been a minute*

Every time my life gets thrown out of wack — even in a good way — I forget the key ingredient that always makes things better. Even when I do remember, I forget the second most important part. Routine always provides me guidance. Feeling lost is one of the feelings that's most constant in my life, and it's one of the more unpleasant feelings that I get.

I don't like being aimless — nothing to do, no movement, no direction. It often comes after the aforementioned shake-up because what provides a sense of purpose is the consistency and slight repetition, and most importantly, the stability of having a schedule. There is little room for listless meandering when there is a set of things that must be done. Work now is almost the easiest part of my day in this respect, but now I have to bring that structure back home.

Even after remembering that, as I said, I forget the second most important part: It takes time. A routine is not a routine after a day, even if I'm doing the makings of a routine. It's an important distinction and I often confuse it. I might feel off because I haven't been working out, so I do some cardio or move weights around. Then I wonder why I don't feel much better (although I often feel *somewhat* better). I mistake a routine for the things that make a routine. But a routine is what is done consistently, good or bad.

Starting today, I'm hoping back on the bandwagon. I'm tired of no exercise, eating out, sitting lethargically waiting for the next work day. Mediation, cooking, reading, and creating are the things I want. The faster I can bounce back into a routine, the faster I will feel better anytime I return to my aimless wandering. Now I just need to remember.
