In the journey of gaining self-respect, it's easy to tell myself I'm being selfish. Many times when I've stood up for myself, I've been convinced that my position is unreasonable or that I'm asking for too much. So now, when I get pushback from what *I* think is speaking my truth, I fold much more easily because I'm so unsure of my beliefs and not confident enough in myself.

I'm not sure if this is an excuse I tell myself, as to not become unreasonable or selfish, or instead if I'm just holding myself back with old beliefs. It's possible that the practice of standing up for myself will make it clear what is right and what is wrong, and that as long as I am stick to my values, I don't need to worry.

Ultimately that seems right. Yes, broader adherence to what is "universally" right and wrong is important to me, philosophically, but as a human being, practically, I should maybe operate around core, intuitive values. Using values as touchstones seems like a good option, providing both a solid structure, while also staying practical. In the end, I'm probably worried too much about making the correct decision every time, and the times where I feel I have to speak, it's probably for a good reason.
