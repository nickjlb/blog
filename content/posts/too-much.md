I think it's easy to fill compelled to capture as much knowledge as possible. I always want to go through all my RSS feeds, read every article that seems remotely interesting, and be complete by the end of the day. More information, however, just isn't helpful. Constantly we are inundated with data and the idea that we must always be consuming. It's accepted as the baseline, but it's honestly exhausting to actually *do*, if you think about it.

It's difficult to relax because I feel a pressure to be doing, which I believe means I'm operating [out of spec](/posts/changing-brain/ "New Beliefs. | mental excess."). Yes, as a human being I always want to be moving forward, but on the other hand, rest and downtime is necessary. I want to be able to enjoy my free time when I have it, without feeling the mental pressure of deadlines and responsibility.

From my viewpoint, life isn't simply about being maximally productive. It's about cultivating the best version of ourselves, however small a footprint we make. Being the best version of ourselves generally does not align with capitalistic incentives, and it's why I believe that work isn't ever going to be a primary source of fulfillment.

I also believe that being the best version of ourselves, has positive ripple effects on those around us. Accepting others, being kind, listening, being patient, gracious, and appreciative can — I believe — make our *own* lives better as well.

There is no fate, no forces that are benevolent or malevolent in this universe. So, we must carry ourselves through.
