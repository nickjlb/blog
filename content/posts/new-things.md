I find it very difficult to maintain, but I've realized that doing things that aren't painful, but are uncomfortable, pushes me into being a better human. Small things, like being alone in public, going to stores, asking for various items â€” baby steps towards being comfortable and getting better at multiple things at once.

It's useful because of how many things it exercises at once. Just like a compound movement at the gym, instead of hyper-focusing on one area of development, you can attack a multitude simultaneously. And the beauty of being human is that you learn by simply experiencing, rather than dedicating intense study to the subject.

In the past, I've tried doing one new thing everyday, but it's difficult for me to maintain. It's something I want to bring back, though, and hopefully I can build it into a stronger habit.
