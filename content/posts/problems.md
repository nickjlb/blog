I've realized that I've had so much anxiety, and I've been so focused on eliminating it that when I feel normal, acceptable levels of stress, I interpret it as unnecessary and unwanted, when instead it's more of call to action than an irrational feeling.

Now that I've gained better control over the way I feel and process stress, anxiety can feel more acute when it does happen because my brain is saying, "Why isn't this just going away?!". It made me realize, though, that the rational anxiety isn't going to disappear until I deal with the source. Most of my anxiety can be cleared with perspective, yes, but some of it needs to be remedied through action.

As I become more proficient at distinguishing between rational and irrational stress, I think it will make me a much better problem-solver, as I'll know what I have control over, and what I don't. Additionally, it can get rid of this victim/paralysis mindset and spur me into action when that's what's necessary.
