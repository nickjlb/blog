I've rediscovered my love for discussing society, incentives, structures, and philosophy that I encountered most while at college. And it made me realize, I can't just listen and reflect upon the ills of society. The problems aren't hypothetical â€” they involve real people that face these issues each day. Perhaps I can't change the world, but I believe I can effect change locally. On the other hand, maybe dreaming big is worthwhile, because I should wring out any potential from the future I may have. Most importantly, it's not enough to believe in ideals, I need to stand by them.

That's also inspired me to try vegetarianism. Veganism would be the ultimate form of adhering to my beliefs, but vegetarianism is a solid first step. In philosophy papers and general conversation, I've often argued that it's unfair to kill animals indiscriminately, based on the reasoning we use now like intelligence, or that we have a "soul". I don't buy most of these arguments (which I can explain at another time) and figure it's time to stop being a hypocrite, the greatest philosophical faux pas, while doing something meaningful for society, animals, and the climate, all through my purchasing power.

Lastly, I realized many ideas rattling around my brain are potentially worth sharing. If I can start seriously writing academic-style papers, posts, articles, etc., and maybe even return to grad school to get that academic street cred, I might be able to change society in minor, but important ways. I've always thought a lot about the intersection of inequality, society, philosophy, and incentives, so this is my way of giving back, hopefully, changing and improving the world.
