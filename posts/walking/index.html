To get to <em>any</em> place, you need to drive, find someone who can drive, or navigate the often slow and dismal public transit routes, all of which I&rsquo;ve experienced in excess, first-hand. Although it sounds relatively negative, I enjoyed this. Driving is something I love because, especially early-on in my life, it provides this immense feeling of freedom and control, despite everything else being in disarray.</p><p>Unfortunately, driving is not nearly as liberating when it becomes mandatory. It&rsquo;s also extremely expensive over time, and not convenient when you face rush hour traffic, or even just parking. However, because I lived in California, these daily inconveniences were frustrating, but not something I really questioned. This is how our infrastructure works.</p><p>When I first moved to Seattle, my understanding of infrastructure and neighborhoods completely shifted. I found an apartment that was a few miles from my job downtown, and my first day, I attempted to drive and park. I quickly learned this was a mistake, after paying $25 for parking during my 8 hour shift that only paid $19 an hour. The next day, after talking to my coworkers about living in Seattle, transportation, rent, and generally the experience up North, I found my bus route that became invaluable to me.</p><p>Perhaps I was lucky, but this route was a 1 minute walk from my apartment, and a 1 minute walk from the office. It was direct, and took 20 minutes at most, whereas my drive would take about 20-30, without parking. This was just the start.</p><p>To drive most places within Seattle is a mistake. The roads are generally in terrible condition, there is often construction, and the streets — even the main thoroughfares — are overly narrow. Not to mention how steep many of these streets are and the immense amount of traffic. It&rsquo;s unpleasant. What Seattle lacks in basic infrastructure for cars, however, benefits most pedestrians.</p><p>Although I lived in a relatively nice, trendy area, near Capitol Hill, the walkability was unparalleled with any experience I&rsquo;ve had in Southern California. I can&rsquo;t speak to the Norcal experience, but here, driving is all but required, unless you want to walk 20+ minutes to the nearest grocery store.</p><p>From my apartment, I was a 3 minute walk to Safeway, 5 minute walk to Trader Joe&rsquo;s, 7 minute walk from another Safeway, along with at least 20 to 30 different restaurants within a 10 minute walking distance. I suppose the rain dampens the enthusiasm to walk somewhat, but it&rsquo;s what makes Seattle so beautiful to traverse. I have a feeling that the emphasis on nature within the city encourages walking as well.</p><hr><p>There&rsquo;s been a significant amount of discourse (and <a href=https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-15-minute-city-conspiracy-162fd388f0c435a8289cc9ea213f92ee>conspiracy</a>) around the idea of the &ldquo;<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15-minute_city>15-minute city</a>&rdquo;. The idea is that cities become much better for their residents — safer, cleaner, more inexpensive — because they don&rsquo;t require<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> vehicles to live. There are certainly real criticisms, such as the practicality of changing current cities to meet such a design and issues of gentrification displacing lower-income residents. However, the central idea of removing our dependence on cars does not limit our ability to own cars. It actually provides greater freedom and options (ideas Americans should love and appreciate) because we are given the ability to choose.</p><p>My own experience reflects why this is so important. While living in Seattle, I drove — <em>at most</em> — 2 days a week, only on the weekend. This isn&rsquo;t because I hate cars and hate other drivers (although we&rsquo;ve all had our moments), but rather because not being required to pay for gas, put on miles, and deal with parking became so valuable once I had the choice. I love roadtrips, and I still drive hundreds of miles alone, with no aim, just because I can. But having the option to not be forced to drive, made those times I chose to that much better.</p><p>By being given the option to drive, without being required to, those who can&rsquo;t afford cars (which really are a significant expense) can still go to work and meet their needs. Children are also a lot safer when there are less cars on the road, especially with <a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/americas-cars-trucks-are-getting-bigger-are-front-blind-zones-children-rcna52109>America&rsquo;s current trend</a> of bigger and heavier vehicles. Living close to everything we need simply gives us more options, and it makes meeting those needs much more comfortable.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>By <em>&ldquo;require&rdquo;</em>, I don&rsquo;t mean legally mandate or force, but instead that as I&rsquo;ve described, many cities functionally require a vehicle to acquire basic needs.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></p></div><div class=prev-next><div class=prev-post><p><a href=/posts/tools/>&#8592;
