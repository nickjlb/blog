&lt;p>In general, I&amp;rsquo;m someone that has always been interested in, and thinks a lot about systems, and what they incentivise based on their structure. Whether that&amp;rsquo;s in terms of governments, sports, urban design, websites, or any other system that revolves around human interaction. Lately, that focus, as you may have &lt;a href="https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/incentives" title="Accepting Different Terms. | mental excess.">seen&lt;/a> has been on social networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve heavily researched &lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech" title="Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech">alternative ideas&lt;/a> for social networks. This is mostly inspired by my interest in privacy and trying to understand how these social networks affect society at large. Although I&amp;rsquo;m not an incredibly active participant on social media, I can see how nuance is removed from concepts and ideas and then spread around quickly, informing us with a twisted, misrepresented version of reality.

In my head, I want everything to be clean and tidy â€” one network that did everything. Created great, strong communities, answered questions about various issues, felt tight-knit and allowed for reasonable discussions, all very pie-in-the-sky.

Criticisms of their practices of election meddling, attention-stealing, data collecting, and generally being cesspools of humanity. Many of these companies have created walled gardens that discourage platform departure and have been optimized to be as attention-grabbing as possible. After all, more usage generates greater revenue, even if it&amp;rsquo;s at the detriment of a beneficial experience for the user.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
