Many times when I&amp;rsquo;ve stood up for myself, I&amp;rsquo;ve been convinced that my position is unreasonable or that I&amp;rsquo;m asking for too much. So now, when I get pushback from what &lt;em>I&lt;/em> think is speaking my truth, I fold much more easily because I&amp;rsquo;m so unsure of my beliefs and not confident enough in myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is an excuse I tell myself, as to not become unreasonable or selfish, or instead if I&amp;rsquo;m just holding myself back with old beliefs. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that the practice of standing up for myself will make it clear what is right and what is wrong, and that as long as I am stick to my values, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Releasing the Tethers.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/tethers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 18:03:23 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/tethers/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that what&amp;rsquo;s caused me a ton of anguish is attaching a portion of my identity to inherently unstable and impermanent states. If those states change, as they do, I find it excruciating and impossible to function, because I feel as if a portion of me is destroyed in the process. It means that I will cling to these ephemeral states and force them, even when they are due to change, always to my own detriment or the detriment of others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taking Action.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/problems/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/problems/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve had so much anxiety, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been so focused on eliminating it that when I feel normal, acceptable levels of stress, I interpret it as unnecessary and unwanted, when instead it&amp;rsquo;s more of call to action than an irrational feeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gained better control over the way I feel and process stress, anxiety can feel more acute when it does happen because my brain is saying, &amp;ldquo;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t this just going away?!&amp;rdquo;. It made me realize, though, that the rational anxiety isn&amp;rsquo;t going to disappear until I deal with the source. Most of my anxiety can be cleared with perspective, yes, but some of it needs to be remedied through action.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Beliefs.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/changing-brain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 22:47:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/changing-brain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past few months, I have done some extensive introspection. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time on my hands, it&amp;rsquo;s become much, much easier to feel every little pang that comes about, and there is much less to distract me. In that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized how strong this constant, incessant background anxiety was that I&amp;rsquo;ve been carrying around. Even in times of ease and safety, I still found it gripping ahold and refusing to let go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reality through Perception.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/mindcontrol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 01:06:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/mindcontrol/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to arrive at the idea that there is a significant distinction between how our brain perceives reality, and how reality actually is. It&amp;rsquo;s always been my assumption that what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing and feeling represents the reality of the situation I&amp;rsquo;m in. If I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed or frustrated, it&amp;rsquo;s because the situation is objectively disappointing or frustrating. I have come to find that this belief is often false.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I perceive a situation, my senses attempt to provide the most accurate, objective version of reality, minimizing their own biases as much as possible. After this point, I begin to filter that data through my brain, where I began to make assertions about the situation, project my own thoughts and feelings, create nebulous connections, and personify the previously objective reality.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
