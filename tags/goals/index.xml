There aren&amp;rsquo;t any specific goals I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to reach for, and I wonder if that resonates with others. Having dreams, especially distinct ones, is often portrayed in America. But perhaps as a byproduct of my aimlessness, I seem to lack any.

I also read that I may have to start paying off the student loans of which I am wholly unequipped, given the above situation. What a pain.
Over the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve told myself and others that while I&amp;rsquo;m young, I want to be flexible and not completely tied down to a place.</description></item></channel></rss>
