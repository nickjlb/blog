The reaction online, sadly, is extremely positive and to some degree, I can understand the reaction. When healthcare in America is so severely screwed up, the blame to a large extent is on these huge profit making entities. But I believe this reaction is both disturbing and misguided.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These companies are heinous in their treatment of their customers. Leaving so many in horrible situations, in the worst (and unfortunately, extremely common) cases, patients are left with both pain and crushing debt, which feed into each other. But they are not the flaws in the system, exploiting people because they are operating as vigilantes. They are the system that the government has allowed to prosper, with lawmakers ultimately being responsible for allowing their practices to go completely unchecked, and the most disadvantaged are left holding the bag.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
