Each decision I make reinforces a path. It&amp;rsquo;s opportunity cost but supercharged, in that one decision can rule out other options, but by choosing something over another in reinforces that behavior to the brain. The question isn&amp;rsquo;t how to have pure willpower to do make the right decisions, although that is certainly a part of it, the question is how to shape my life to incentive the right decisions.</description></item><item><title>Breaking Through.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/breaking-thru/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 23:57:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/breaking-thru/</guid><description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s important for me to remember all the things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget and become an amorphous blob navigating through life and losing all the things that provide purpose. And it happens in subtle ways, when I get out of practice I lose the skills to further my ability to do those things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do.
Like writing. I don&amp;rsquo;t just want to wait until the perfect storm of motivation and inspiration collide for me to practice writing, reading, meditating, cooking, programming, working out, and making music.</description></item><item><title>Course Correction.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/course-correction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Sep 2023 20:42:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/course-correction/</guid><description>Everyday, it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m failing to correct. I have a list of all my biggest issues, I&amp;rsquo;m aware of what needs to change, but I don&amp;rsquo;t take the steps to fix it. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy for me to just keep following the same patterns, without adjusting anything, but recently more than usual, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing a voice that&amp;rsquo;s asking me to make these changes. I need to start taking small, consistent steps so I can stay on top of what I need to do.</description></item><item><title>Finding My Way.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/rhythm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 20:06:19 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/rhythm/</guid><description>Despite the last post, I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling to find that rhythm. I realized I&amp;rsquo;m holding myself back significantly in multiple ways. I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on my confidence in any major way, and that&amp;rsquo;s slowing me. Adding to that is my ability to make excuses for not starting anything. The only way to get better is to put in consistent work. Whether I want to make music, write, skate, or improve my mental health â€” I have to stick to it.</description></item></channel></rss>
