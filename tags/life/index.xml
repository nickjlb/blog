Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gained better control over the way I feel and process stress, anxiety can feel more acute when it does happen because my brain is saying, &amp;ldquo;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t this just going away?</description></item><item><title>Processing it All.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/too-much/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:09:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/too-much/</guid><description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s easy to fill compelled to capture as much knowledge as possible. I always want to go through all my RSS feeds, read every article that seems remotely interesting, and be complete by the end of the day. More information, however, just isn&amp;rsquo;t helpful. Constantly we are inundated with data and the idea that we must always be consuming. It&amp;rsquo;s accepted as the baseline, but it&amp;rsquo;s honestly exhausting to actually do, if you think about it.</description></item><item><title>New Beliefs.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/changing-brain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 22:47:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/changing-brain/</guid><description>Over the past few months, I have done some extensive introspection. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time on my hands, it&amp;rsquo;s become much, much easier to feel every little pang that comes about, and there is much less to distract me. In that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized how strong this constant, incessant background anxiety was that I&amp;rsquo;ve been carrying around. Even in times of ease and safety, I still found it gripping ahold and refusing to let go.</description></item><item><title>Reality through Perception.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/mindcontrol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 01:06:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/mindcontrol/</guid><description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to arrive at the idea that there is a significant distinction between how our brain perceives reality, and how reality actually is. It&amp;rsquo;s always been my assumption that what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing and feeling represents the reality of the situation I&amp;rsquo;m in. If I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed or frustrated, it&amp;rsquo;s because the situation is objectively disappointing or frustrating. I have come to find that this belief is often false.
When I perceive a situation, my senses attempt to provide the most accurate, objective version of reality, minimizing their own biases as much as possible.</description></item><item><title>It's All In Your Head.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/tools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:02:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/tools/</guid><description>It can be difficult to identify whether anxiety can simply be overcome through thought or a shift in thinking. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s literally in the mind, what is the difference between a healthy mind and one that overthinks? Mental disorders in general are fuzzy, and somewhat undefined as they manifest differently in everyone. This can make me somewhat skeptical of our understanding of psychology because it seems so undefined, and we don&amp;rsquo;t know and can&amp;rsquo;t observe those interactions.</description></item><item><title>Something Important to Me.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/start/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 22:35:53 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/start/</guid><description>I used to be obsessed with the idea of legacy. This concept was pervasive â€” I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let go of wanting to be important or wanting to be recognized as important. This idea stuck with me for years, despite not actually working towards greatness or high achievement.
I think when you&amp;rsquo;re especially young, it can be easy to succumb to the ego and seek to defeat death, something intangible and scary.</description></item></channel></rss>
