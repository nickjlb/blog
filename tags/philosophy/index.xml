I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling lost recently, really lost. I feel out of balance and unable to stabilize anything in my life. I just want some semblance of control and every measure that I take feels like it&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough to shift that balance. I was reminded today, listening to a &lt;a href="https://megaphone.link/VMP2076192826" title="Life is hard. Can philosophy help? | The Gray Area with Sean Illing">podcast&lt;/a> that most of our lives is spend aiming for goals. But it&amp;rsquo;s a paradoxical activity, because we spend time in anticipation of reaching that goal, waiting for it to provide us what we want, to make us happy. But when we reach it, it suddenly becomes the past and no longer can bring us what we want. Our time is much better used if we learn to like the doing, which does not at all mean that the doing always needs to make us happy. Part of the doing is experiencing difficult and sometimes terrible things. But goals don&amp;rsquo;t provide us with much at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Drive Revived.</title><link>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/rebooted/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2023 19:14:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://vault.nickbanning.com/posts/rebooted/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve rediscovered my love for discussing society, incentives, structures, and philosophy that I encountered most while at college. And it made me realize, I can&amp;rsquo;t just listen and reflect upon the ills of society. The problems aren&amp;rsquo;t hypothetical â€” they involve real people that face these issues each day. Perhaps I can&amp;rsquo;t change the world, but I believe I can effect change locally. On the other hand, maybe dreaming big is worthwhile, because I should wring out any potential from the future I may have. Most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to believe in ideals, I need to stand by them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
